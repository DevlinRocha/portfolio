Continuing last night studies into today — I’ve learned quite a lot! I’m doing the preliminary work now and almost ready to start the 100 Days Of Code challenge!

I’ve put Python to the side for now to focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.

I’ve finished setting up a virtual machine on my laptop with Linux installed — my first foray into the operating system! I dabbled with learning the command line interface while trying not to overwhelm myself too much while I’m still learning to code, but it’s a necessary step outside of my comfort zone!

Once that was finished I set up my development environment with Visual Studio Code and a live server extension, set up Git and connected it to my GitHub account I created. With that all out of the way I should be ready to start a coding challenge very soon, but I’ve got a lot more work to do and I don’t want to rush the process.
