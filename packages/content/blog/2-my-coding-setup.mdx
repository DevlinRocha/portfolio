![My coding setup — a laptop playing lofi music with an open notepad in front. There are hand-written notes about Python functions and decorators.](https://images.devlin.workers.dev/IMG_2461.jpeg)

My modest setup along with an update for the day:

Despite wanting to get an early jump on beginning my education on web development, I just love Python too much! I got distracted learning about function decorators and nested functions!

The rest of the night I am doing the preliminary work on The Odin Project. I’ve been very excited to begin ever since hearing about it, although I admit I am intimidated by being “forced” to switch to Linux. While I’m comfortable with MacOS and Windows, Linux is something entirely new for me and from what I hear it can be a daunting process and I’ll lose a lot of everyday functionality!

I’ll most likely end up setting up some sort of dual boot setup, however I’m limited on storage space as is and that sounds like a time consuming process that will only take away from my coding time! But I guess it’s all a part of the process…

What operating system do you use? Should I make the switch to Linux?!
